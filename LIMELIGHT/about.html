    <h2>Anonymous Associates is coordination of social experiment, textiles and graphic design presented as multimedia fashion capsule. </h2>
    
    For my final project, I wanted to work on something that would showcase my various skills, interests and design aesthetic. I have developed a brand - Anonymous Associates - and designed a range of garments that act make up the debut capsule <em>LIMELIGHT</em>. I designed the graphics which were screenprinted onto garments made from recycled clothing, them ran a photoshoot to capture the images used in the zine. I coded this website to act as a virtual extension of the brand and continuation of project 1. I then designed the zine publication designed for use as a look book for the capsule.
    <br>
    Combining my skills and interests, the LIMELIGHT project is formed off research and experiment into the way strangers communicate with each other on the back of public bathroom doors. These public private spaces that exist in our cities mirror the way messages gain attention and are spread on the online community.
<br>
<br>
    This research and enquiry led to deeper thinking about the ways in which we communicate and form our own understandings of self identity. In a society so overwhelmed with mass content both online and in the ever developing cities we inhabit, trends move and change at rapid fire pace sanctions of society that were once niche, secretive or taboo have been opened to everyone with access to a mobile phone. How sustainable is shock value when we're exposed to ever expanding feats? 
<br> 
<br>
    The cyber platforms we inhabit give a voice to those previously not heard. But while there is more access to spreading your thoughts/values/creativity/opinions/art... there is a flood of content from countless other users to compete against. Two yearly fashion seasons has become 52 seasons, and political and protest movements are like trends that burn red hot and fast only to  extinguish after a few mere weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
    A desire for validation is human nature, and as we compete with others for the limelight, is it possible to stay true to our own identities and values?
  <br>
  <br>
    Anonymous Associates is a brand that examines the ways strangers interract with each other online and IRL and creates multi-faceted art, design and fashion to build a conversation. The LIMELIGHT capsule is an attempt to give people the chance to say what they really mean and really think, by opening up an anonymous forum, accessible via a link printed on the garments. The juxtaposition of the word "limelight"  with illustrations of avatar style characters, modelled by figures with their heads covered, creates a conversation that....

     Research led to the design of graphic that were screen printed onto garments (designed in collaboration with @sig.studios), were then photographed and composed in a print look book. The capsule comes full cycle when users visit the link printed on garments and are taken to a site where they can anonymously answer and view other responses to the introspective prompt – what makes you unique?
